## Grading detail
For the first and second problem, passing all test of each then you can get full score.
If you fail n tests, you will lose n point correspondingly. The point will not become negative.

For the bonus problem, passing all test you can get full score. If you fail n tests, you will lose n point correspondingly. The point will not become negative.

## How to get bonus point
You need to modify `ridge_regression.py`, change the `skip` attribute to `False`
to enable the unit test of `TestRidgeModel`. Passing all the tests of
`TestRidgeModel` then you can get the bonus 2.5 point.
